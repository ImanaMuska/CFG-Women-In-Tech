  Susan Diane Wojcicki is a Polish-American technology executive. She has been the CEO of YouTube since February 2014.
  Wojcicki was involved in the founding of Google, and became Google's first marketing manager in 1999. She was in charge of
  Google's original video service, and after observing the success of YouTube, proposed the acquisition of YouTube by Google in
  2006.
  Wojcicki has an estimated net worth of nearly $500 million.
  Wojcicki, called "the most important person in advertising", was named one of Time's 100 most influential people in 2015 and
  described in a later issue of Time as “the most powerful woman on the Internet”.
 In the time that Wojcicki has been CEO of YouTube, the company announced that it had reached 1.9 billion logged-in users a month
 and that users were watching one billion hours a day. Since taking on the role of CEO, YouTube's percentage of female
 employees has risen from 24 to nearly 30 percent.
Wojcicki also oversaw the development and release of new YouTube applications and experiences designed to cater to users interested
in family gaming, and music content. She also oversaw the launch of YouTube's advertisement-free subscription service, YouTube
Premium (formerly known as YouTube Red), and its over-the-top (OTT) internet television service YouTube TV.
