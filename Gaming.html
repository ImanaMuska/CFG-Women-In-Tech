    <h2 style="font-size:30px;">Dona Bailey</h2>

    <p>
      Dona Bailey is an American video game programmer and educator who, along with
      Ed Logg in 1981, created the arcade video game Centipede.
      As a young programmer Bailey was hired by General Motors and trained in
      assembly language programming. She worked there for two years on displays,
      and microprocessor-based cruise control systems. She became interested in
      Space Invaders and the world of arcade games, another application of the work
      she was doing at GM. She found out that Atari was using the same
      microprocessor in its games.
      <br>
      In 1980, Bailey joined Atari's coin-op division, where she was the only woman.
      In an interview Bailey recalled that Atari had a notebook of possible game
      ideas at the time. Of the 30 or so entries the only one without "lasering or
      frying things" was a short description of a bug winding down the screen.
      "It didn't seem bad to shoot a bug".
      <br>
      Bailey left Atari in 1982 and went to work at Videa (later renamed
      Sente Technologies), founded by three former Atari employees. In 2007, she
      was the keynote speaker at the Women in Games International Conference. Bailey
      holds M.Ed. and M.A. degrees and taught as a faculty member in the department
      of Rhetoric and Writing at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock until her
      retirement.
